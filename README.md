# GrowthBook Proxy

[GrowthBook](https://www.growthbook.io) is a modular Feature Flagging and Experimentation platform.

The GrowthBook Proxy server sits between your application and GrowthBook. It turbocharges your GrowthBook implementation by providing **speed**, **scalability**, **security**, and **real-time** feature rollouts.

### Features:
- :zap: **Caching** - Significantly faster feature lookups!
  - In-memory cache plus an optional distributed layer (Redis or MongoDB)
  - Automatic cache invalidation when features change in GrowthBook (using WebHooks)
- :satellite: **Streaming** - Updates your application in real-time as features are changed or toggled (Javascript and React only)
- :lock: **Secure** - Private-key authentication between GrowthBook and GrowthBook Proxy
- :left_right_arrow: **Horizontally Scalable** - Support millions of concurrent users

### Coming soon:

- Server-side targeting and feature evaluation
- Realtime feature usage monitoring and alerting
- Additional support for edge deployments
- Streaming support for more SDKs

## Installation

Install and run with Docker

```bash
docker pull growthbook/proxy:latest
docker run -d -p 3300:3300 \
  -e "GROWTHBOOK_API_HOST=https://growthbook-api.example.com" \
  -e "SECRET_API_KEY=key_abc123" \
  --name gbproxy growthbook/proxy
```

Then, simply point your GrowthBook SDKs to the GrowthBook Proxy instead of the GrowthBook API.

You will also need to ensure that your self-hosted GrowthBook instance is configured to use the proxy server. This includes setting environment variables:
```
PROXY_ENABLED=1
PROXY_HOST_PUBLIC=https://proxy.example.com

## Optional; you may also use the GrowthBook UI to set this:
SECRET_API_KEY=something_secret
```
See GrowthBook's [Proxy documentation](https://docs.growthbook.io/self-host/proxy#standalone) for more information.


## Configuration

The GrowthBook Proxy supports a number of configuration options available via environment variables:

- `GROWTHBOOK_API_HOST` - Set this to the host and port of your GrowthBook API instance
- `SECRET_API_KEY` - Create a secret API key in GrowthBook by going to **Settings -> API Keys**
- `NODE_ENV` - Set to "production" to hide debug and informational log messages
- `CACHE_ENGINE` - One of: `memory`, `redis`, or `mongo`
- `CACHE_CONNECTION_URL` - The URL of your redis or mongo cluster (if using)
- `CACHE_STALE_TTL` - Number of seconds until a cache entry is considered stale
- `CACHE_EXPIRES_TTL` - Number of seconds until a cache entry is expired

For MongoDB, you can optionally set the following options:
- `CACHE_DATABASE_NAME` - Mongo database name (default is `proxy`)
- `CACHE_COLLECTION_NAME` - Mongo collection name (default is `cache`)

For horizontally scaled GrowthBook Proxy clusters, we provide a basic mechanism for keeping your proxy instances in sync, which uses Redis Pub/Sub. To use this feature, you must use Redis as your cache engine and set the following option:
- `PUBLISH_PAYLOAD_TO_CHANNEL` - "true" or "1" to enable

You can also configure the GrowthBook Proxy to handle SSL termination. It supports HTTP/2 by default, which is required for high performance streaming.

- `USE_HTTP2` - "true" or "1" to enable
- `HTTPS_CERT` - The SSL certificate
- `HTTPS_KEY` - The SSL key
